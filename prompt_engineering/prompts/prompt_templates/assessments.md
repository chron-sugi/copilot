Prompt Patterns: General Framework
For Future Assessments
When asking for "completeness and accuracy" of a guide, you can strengthen it with: Tier 1 - Verification (I did this):
"Verify all factual claims"
"Check against official documentation"
"Identify inaccuracies"
Tier 2 - Feature Coverage (I partially did this):
"Identify missing features or capabilities"
"Compare to other reference materials"
"Note version-specific requirements"
Tier 3 - Practical Wisdom :
"Identify best practices and gotchas"
"Surface non-obvious constraints"
"Consider performance and optimization"
"Think about common user mistakes"
"Apply relevant system design principles"
