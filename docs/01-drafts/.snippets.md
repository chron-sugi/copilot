- Unit / integration tests:
  - Colocate with the module (no `__tests__` folders).
  - Example: `FeatureThing.tsx` → `FeatureThing.test.tsx` in the same folder.

- E2E tests:
  - Do NOT colocate with feature source files.
  - Place them in the root-level E2E folder:
    - `e2e/<featureName>/*.e2e.spec.ts` (or tool-specific path like `playwright/tests/<featureName>/*.spec.ts`).
  - Organize by feature or user flow to mirror the feature-first structure.
