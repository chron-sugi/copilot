- Unit / integration tests:
  - Colocate with the module (no `__tests__` folders).
  - Example: `FeatureThing.tsx` → `FeatureThing.test.tsx` in the same folder.

- E2E tests:
  - Do NOT colocate with feature source files.
  - Place them in the root-level E2E folder:
    - `e2e/<featureName>/*.e2e.spec.ts` (or tool-specific path like `playwright/tests/<featureName>/*.spec.ts`).
  - Organize by feature or user flow to mirror the feature-first structure.


# TAILWIND BEST PRACTICES
1. You asked about where custom CSS selectors should live in a Tailwind CSS project.
I explained the modern best practice:

Keep custom CSS minimal

Use a src/styles/ folder

Organize into globals.css, components.css, and utilities.css

Wrap selectors inside Tailwind layers (@layer components, @layer utilities)

Prefer prefixing like c-, u-, a- for clarity and LLM-friendliness

2. You asked how colors are changed in Tailwind.
I explained that you do NOT change colors via custom CSS. Instead you use:

Tailwind utility classes (bg-blue-500, text-slate-900)

Tailwind config (extend.colors) to add custom palettes

CSS variables inside @layer base, referenced in the Tailwind config

Custom CSS is only needed for:

Pseudo-elements

Third-party overrides

Advanced animations

Very special cases

Otherwise, colors should always be changed via utilities or Tailwind config.
