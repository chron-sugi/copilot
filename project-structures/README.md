A great README.md typically follows this structure:

## Essential Sections

1. **Project Title & Description** (2-4 sentences)
   - What the project does
   - Why it exists / problem it solves

2. **Installation** (5-15 lines)
   - Prerequisites
   - Step-by-step setup commands

3. **Usage** (10-30 lines)
   - Basic examples with code blocks
   - Common use cases
   - Quick start guide

4. **Key Features** (3-8 bullet points)
   - Core functionality highlights

## Optional but Recommended

5. **Configuration** - If applicable
6. **API/Documentation** - Link to detailed docs
7. **Contributing** - Guidelines for contributors
8. **License** - License type
9. **Contact/Support** - How to get help

## Best Practices

- **Length**: 150-400 lines for most projects
  - Simple libraries: 100-200 lines
  - Complex applications: 300-500 lines
  - Avoid going beyond 600 lines (link to wiki/docs instead)

- **Formatting**:
  - Use code blocks with syntax highlighting
  - Add badges (build status, version, license) at top
  - Include screenshots/GIFs for UI projects
  - Use relative links to other repo files

- **Tone**: Clear, concise, welcoming to newcomers

The goal: A developer should understand what your project is, install it, and run a basic example within 5 minutes of reading.
