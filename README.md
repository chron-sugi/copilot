# copilot

This repository contains Copilot custom chatmodes, instructions and prompt templates used for AI-assisted development workflows.

Top-level contents are mostly under the `.github/` directory (chatmodes, instructions and prompts).

If the repository appears empty in the web UI, check the branch selector (ensure `main`) and the `.github/` folder.

Notes:
- I removed an invalid file named `NUL` (Windows reserved device name) that prevented git from staging files.
- Line-ending warnings were seen during staging (LF -> CRLF) on Windows. Add a `.gitattributes` if you want to normalize endings.
